\section{DM Software Product Tree}\label{sec:swptree}

This section presents the \gls{DM} software product tree, listing all operational \gls{DM} software products.
The full product tree is available in \citeds{LDM-294}.

As of May 2019, this list is still a proposal and none of the software products included here are correctly defined as per the definition in \ref{sec:swdef}.

The \textit{Science Pipelines Distribution} is included in the list since it is the only \gls{DM} product that is currently released.
However this is not strictly speacking a Software Product but a distribution.
It includes all Science Pipelines Software Products, test data, development and build tools, and everything else that is required by \gls{LSST} users to do science with the \gls{LSST} data products.
