\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The current situation is  that, only the Science Pipelines is released as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Stable releases every 6 months
\item Weekly builds
\item Nightly builds
\end{itemize}

The current release process requires few weeks to make an official release available.

For this reasons weekly builds are largely used, since they provide the most up to date and stable software.
