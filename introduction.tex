\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

This document collects the needs in therms of releses from different stakehoders, section \ref{sec:reqs}.
These needs are presented as requirements, that shall not be confused with project requirements, like for example the \gls{DMS} requirement specification, documented in \citeds{LSE-61}.
Section \ref{sec:process} provides an overview of the release process.

Appedix \ref{sec:defs} provides definitions of the main objects involved in the release activities. 
Those definitions are given in order to provide a common understanding.
In the same line, appendix \ref{sec:swptree} gives an overview of the software products part of the \gls{DM}, that are involved in this process.

\section{Science Pipelines Releases}\label{sec:sci}

The current situation is that only the Science Pipelines product is released regularly.
The process in place provides time based builds and releases:

\begin{itemize}
\item Nightly builds
\item Weekly builds
\item Official releases every 6 months
\end{itemize}

The time needed to consolidate an official release from a weekly build is considerable.
Usually 2 or 3 weeks are sufficient but in some cases it may take more than a month. 
Technical details and problems are given in \citeds{DMTN-106}.

Due to the time issue, when a release is available to the users, it is already too old.
For this reason, users prefer in general weekly builds, that are sufficiently stable and include all new functionalities completed in the last week.
