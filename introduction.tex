\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The current situation is  that
\begin{itemize}
\item Stable releases every 6 months
\item Weekly builds
\item Nightly builds
\end{itemize}

The current release process requires few weeks to make an official release available.

For this reasons weekly builds are largerly used, since they provide the most up to date and stable software.
